-------------------- Question:
Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make? 
Answer:
990 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much money Tina makes, we need to calculate her earnings day by day and then sum it up for 5 days.
First, let's calculate her regular pay for 8 hours. Her regular pay per hour is $18.0(0, so for 8 hours, she earns:
\[ 8 \times 18 = 144 \]
For any hours beyond 8 (i.e., 10 - 8 = 2 hours of overtime), her hourly wage is $18.00 + $18.00/2 = $27.00. So, for 2 hours of overtime, she earns:
\[ 2 \times 27 = 54 \]
Thus, her total pay for one day (10 hours) is the sum of her regular pay and overtime pay:
\[ 144 + 54 = 198 \]
Since she

Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn? 
Answer:
10 
Response:
<reasoning>
To determine how much Weng earned, we need to calculate the fraction of an hour for which she worked and then multiply by her hourly rate. Weng worked 50 minutes, which is \(\frac{50}{60}\) of an hour. Since she earns $12 per hour, we first convert 50 minutes to hours, which is \(\frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6}\) of an hour. Then we multiply \(\frac{5}{6}\) by $12 to find her earnings.
</reasoning>
<answer>
Weng worked \(\frac{5}{6}\) of an hour. To calculate her earnings, we perform the following calculation:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10
\]
So, Weng earned $10.

-------------------- Question:
Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden? 
Answer:
35 
Response:
<reasoning>
To find the total number of flowers in Mark's garden, we can follow these steps:
1. **Determine the number of purple flowers:**
   Mark has 10 yellow flowers. Purple flowers make up 80% more than the yellow ones. We can calculate the number of purple flowers as follows:
   \[
   \text{Purple flowers} = 10 + (0.80 \times 10) = 10 + 8 = 18
   \]
2. **Determine the number of green flowers:**
   Green flowers are only 25% as many as the number of yellow and purple flowers combined:
   \[
   \text{Yellow and purple flowers combined} = 10 + 18 = 28
   \]
   \[
   \text{Green flowers} = 0.25 \times 28 = 7

-------------------- Question:
Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds? 
Answer:
16 
Response:
<reasoning>
We need to determine the final weight of the box of goodies. To find this, let's follow the operations described:
1. Ken first poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.
2. He then added enough brownies to triple the weight.
3. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.
4. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight.
Let's denote the initial 2 pounds of jelly beans as 2 lbs. When the jelly beans are tripled, the weight becomes \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) lbs. Adding 2 more pounds of jelly beans makes the weight \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) lbs. And finally, doubling this weight makes the final weight \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) lbs.
</reasoning>

The final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds

-------------------- Question:
Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read? 
Answer:
42 
Response:
<reasoning>
Julie has 120 pages to read in total. She read 12 pages yesterday. Today, she read twice as many pages as she did yesterday, which means she read \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pages today. Thus, the total pages she has read so far is \(12 + 24 = 36\) pages. Therefore, the remaining pages to be read are \(120 - 36 = 84\) pages. Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, which means she will read \(84 \div 2 = 42\) pages tomorrow.
</reasoning>
<answer>
Julie should read 42 pages.
